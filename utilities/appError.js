    /// This is commonly used inside a custom error class to generate a proper stack trace without including the constructor itself.

    /// The CustomError class extends Error.
    /// Error.captureStackTrace(this, this.constructor); removes the CustomError constructor from the stack trace.
    /// The stack trace will show only where the error occurred, making debugging cleaner.
    /// ðŸ”¹ Without Error.captureStackTrace
    /// If you donâ€™t use Error.captureStackTrace, the constructor (CustomError) will appear in the stack trace, making it longer and potentially harder to read.

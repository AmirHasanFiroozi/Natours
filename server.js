/// what does precess.on() do is it do the same as addEventListener do in the js?
/// Yes, you're absolutely correct! process.on() in Node.js is very similar to addEventListener() in JavaScript for the browser. Both are used to listen for events and execute a callback function when those events occur. However, they operate in different environments and are used for different types of events.

/// process.on() in Node.js
/// What it does: process.on() is a method provided by the process object in Node.js. It allows you to listen for system-level events or process-related events in a Node.js application.
/// Purpose: It is used to handle events related to the Node.js process, such as:
/// uncaughtException: When an exception is thrown but not caught.
/// unhandledRejection: When a promise is rejected but not handled.
/// exit: When the Node.js process is about to exit.
/// SIGINT: When the process receives an interrupt signal (e.g., Ctrl+C).
/// SIGTERM: When the process receives a termination signal (e.g., from a process manager).

/// 1. server.close()
/// server.close() is a method provided by Node.js (specifically for HTTP servers, Express servers, etc.) that stops the server from accepting new connections.
/// However, it allows existing connections (e.g., ongoing requests) to complete before fully shutting down.
/// This is part of a graceful shutdown process, ensuring that the server doesn't abruptly terminate while handling ongoing requests.
/// What happens when server.close() is called?
/// The server stops listening for new requests (e.g., stops listening on the specified port, like 3000).
/// Existing requests are allowed to finish processing.
/// Once all existing connections are closed, the callback function passed to server.close() is executed.

/// 2. process.exit(1)
/// process.exit() is a method that terminates the Node.js process.
/// The argument 1 is the exit code. In Node.js (and most systems), a non-zero exit code (e.g., 1) indicates that the process is exiting due to an error or failure.
/// When process.exit() is called, the Node.js process stops immediately, and no further code is executed.
/// What happens when process.exit(1) is called?
/// The Node.js process stops.
/// Any remaining code in your application is not executed.
/// The server is fully shut down, and the application stops running.

/// 3. Why Combine server.close() and process.exit()?
/// Graceful Shutdown: server.close() ensures that the server stops accepting new requests but allows ongoing requests to complete. This prevents abrupt termination, which could leave users with incomplete responses or cause data corruption.
/// Forceful Termination: After the server has gracefully closed, process.exit(1) ensures that the Node.js process stops completely. This is important because:
/// It frees up system resources (e.g., memory, CPU).
/// It ensures that the application doesn't hang or remain in an inconsistent state.

/// 4. What Does "Exit the Application" Mean?
/// When we say "exit the application," it means:
/// The server stops listening for new requests (e.g., no more incoming HTTP requests are accepted).
/// The Node.js process stops running.
/// The application is no longer active, and the terminal or environment where it was running is freed up.
/// For example:
/// If your server is running on port 3000, after server.close() and process.exit(1), the port 3000 is no longer occupied by your application.
/// If you try to access http://localhost:3000, you'll get an error (e.g., "Connection refused") because the server is no longer running.

/// 5. When Is This Useful?
/// This pattern is commonly used in production applications to handle critical errors (e.g., uncaught exceptions or unhandled rejections) gracefully. For example:
/// If a critical error occurs (e.g., database connection fails, unexpected bug), you don't want the server to continue running in an inconsistent state.
/// Instead, you log the error, shut down the server gracefully, and restart the application (e.g., using a process manager like PM2 or systemd).

/// This piece of code is a global error handler for unhandled promise rejections in a Node.js application.
/// It ensures that if a promise is rejected and the rejection is not properly handled (i.e., no .catch() or try/catch block is used), the application will log the error, gracefully shut down the server, and exit the process.
/// process.on("unhandledRejection", ...)
/// process is a global object in Node.js that provides information about and control over the current Node.js process.
/// unhandledRejection is an event emitted by the process object whenever a promise is rejected but no error handler (.catch() or try/catch) is attached to it.
/// This event is crucial for catching unexpected errors in asynchronous code (e.g., database queries, API calls, etc.).
process.on('unhandledRejection', (err) => {
  console.log('Unhandled Rejectioüí• Shutting down');
  console.log(err.name, err.message);
  /// server.close(() => { ... })
  /// server.close() stops the server from accepting new connections but allows existing connections to complete.
  /// This is part of a graceful shutdown process, ensuring that the server doesn't abruptly terminate while handling ongoing requests.
  /// The callback function inside server.close() is executed once the server has successfully closed.
  server.close(() => {
    /// process.exit(1)
    /// process.exit(1) terminates the Node.js process.
    /// The argument 1 indicates that the process is exiting with a failure code (non-zero exit codes typically indicate errors)
    /// This ensures that the application stops running after an unhandled rejection, preventing further issues.
    process.exit(1);
  });
